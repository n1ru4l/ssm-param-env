# SSM Parameter Env

Supply your environment with the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)

**FYI** This library is currently not published to npm. If you want to try it out and give feedback you will have to install it with the following command:

`yarn install @n1ru4l/ssm-parameter-env@https://github.com/n1ru4l/ssm-parameter-env.git`

## Usage Example

```js
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const ssm = new AWS.SSM();
const getEnvironment = require("@n1ru4l/ssm-parameter-env");
const expect = require("expect");

const env = {
  MY_SCURR: "ssm:/Scurr/Burr/Eagle",
  MY_BAZZ: "Passthrough value"
};

getEnvironment({ env, ssm }).then(env => {
  expect(env).toEqual({
    MY_SCURR: "TOP SECRET VALUE",
    MY_BAZZ: "Passthrough value"
  }); // true
});
```

More documentation will follow soon. For more detail you can take a look at the [tests](./src/index.test.js) ðŸ˜‡.

## How to use with serverless(-offline)

This plugin should work out of the box with serverless-offline.
You should not any environment variables prefixed with `ssm:` in your local development environment to prevent any request to AWS.

## Required Permissions

[This document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-access.html) should cover all info about permissions.
You will have to give permissions to your target for the following actions: `ssm:GetParameters` and `kms:Decrypt`.
I recommend to group your ssm parameters with a prefix (e.g. `my-project-production/database-password`). By doing so you can restrict the `ssm:GetParameters` to a subset of ssm parameters that start with the shared prefix (e.g. `my-project-production/*`).

**I use serverless and I don't care, I am testing and I just wanne copy paste stuff**

If you do not care about fine graned access control just use these iamRoleStatements (serverless):

```yml
  iamStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - ssm:GetParameters
      Resource: *
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - kms:Decrypt
      Resource: *
```

## Roadmap

* [x] Make it compatible to serverless framework (offline mode)
* [ ] Test in Real World Application
* [ ] Publish to npm
* [ ] Implement caching
